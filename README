PosterBuilder is a small class library for drawing on template images in order to 
create dynamic posters based on your website users accounts.

For instance http://toepoke.co.uk use it so our users can create a poster for 
their games of 5-a-side football which they can put up at work advertising their
game to their work mates.

The poster features a map of where they play and a link (and QR code) to sign up
to the game (based on the user's account).
